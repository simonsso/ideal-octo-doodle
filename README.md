Mercator projection causes length to be distorted propositional to the distance from equator.
The app shows two open street map views, and adjusts the zoom level to compensate for this.

## Known limitations
A map zoomed out to a continental level contains too much distortion in itself to be accurate, adjusting the zoomlevel cannot solve this.
